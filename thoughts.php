<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="escape">Escape to New York</a></h3>
<p>
The high school that I attended threw a holiday party for alumni – in New York.
I drove down to the Trenton train station and jumped on a train heading that way.
I was so nervous I nearly got off the train at Newark Penn Station rather than New York Penn Station.
</p>
<p>
When I got to New York, there were many people waiting for taxi cabs; but no taxi cabs would stop.
Finally, a pedal cab rode up; it’s like a giant tricycle: the driver pedals the tricycle, the passenger sits in the back under a canopy.
The driver was wild and calm, pedaling between buses, zooming in front of cars, dodging hapless pedestrians.
At first I was saying "Watch out!", "Be careful", "What have I gotten myself into?".
But, this driver was really great, so eventually I said "Well done", "Nice move", "Oh, my".
</p>
<p>
When I got to the event, I was so nervous, I had to sit down for a few minutes to collect myself.
It was a very classy place on 7th and 43rd street.
Out of place was I.
Fortunately, I met a few of my classmates: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a photographer/journalist, 
</li><li>
a documentary maker, 
</li><li>
an artist/designer/business owner.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Such are some of the trajactories upon which life has led us.
We had a nice conversation: we remembered things that we barely remembered that we remembered.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me of a song I heard. . .
Yes, indeed from a time 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jhk5MEugJY" target="_blank">before</a> 
and 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3AQXtqY0Es" target="_blank">less before</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>Speak to me of summer<br>
Long winters longer than time can remember<br>
The setting up of other roads<br>
To travel on in old accustomed ways<br>
I still remember the talks by the water<br>
The proud sons and daughters<br>
That knew the knowledge of the land<br>
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways</q>
</blockquote>
<p>    
Not so out of place was I, perhaps. . .
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I met a fellow web developer/programmer/musician of great youth and knowledge, who encouraged me to stay current with the latest web technologies.
</p>
Finally, the party ended, as all parties must.
How was I to negotiate the darting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS0wzDMfzOQ" target="_blank"><q>yellow schools of taxi fishes</q></a> this time?
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I had met another schoolmate, a world traveler, who had graduated a year after I did.
She had spoken to me during my aforementioned "out of place" phase.
She had also travelled by train to this place of celebration.
</p>
<p>
We walked back to the train station and traversed the treacherous terrain – among the surging crowd, amidst the skyscrapers, brightened by the lights - very stylish in our high heels, risking our feet, foot after foot after foot.
</p>
<p>
We continued our conversation as we rode back to our respective train stations, with no doubts about our destinations. . .

<div class="content">
<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="work">"Blessed is he who has found his work."</a></h3>
<p>
"Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at 
work worth doing." So said Theodore Roosevelt in a Labor Day speech in 1903. 
Work is such an integral part of all of our lives. It provides us with 
sustenance and identity. On Labor Day, of course, we formally recognize the 
importance of work.
</p>
<p>
The origin of Labor Day is somewhat is unclear. Some accounts say that Peter J. 
McGuire, a cofounder of the American Federation of Labor, suggested the 
holiday. Other accounts say that Matthew Maguire, a machinist, founded the 
holiday. In any case, the Central Labor Union adopted the idea and planned an 
annual demonstration and picnic to honor workers. The first Labor Day holiday 
was actually on a Tuesday, September 5, 1882 in New York City. Later, in 1884, 
the holiday was set to be the first Monday in September. Soon, the idea caught 
on in other cities. In June of 1894, Congress made Labor Day a legal holiday in 
the District of Columbia and the states. In 1909, the American Federation of 
Labor convened and resolved that the Sunday preceding Labor Day should be 
called Labor Sunday and should be devoted to the spiritual aspect of work.
</p>
<p>
But does work have a spiritual aspect? What, in fact, is work? I suppose there 
are many definitions. Work could simply be the external tasks one performs to 
make a living and survive. Or, it could be the internal effort one makes to 
achieve some spiritual goal. In physics, work is defined as force multiplied by 
distance. I prefer that definition; it seems to encompass everything - the 
mundane, the spiritual and the mathematical.
</p>
<p>
My own work history has been circuitous. I went to college to study electrical 
engineering. Unfortunately, I was beset with doubts; I didn't know what I was 
and what I wanted to do. I stopped college and got a job. I was disappointed in 
myself but at least I was a good citizen capable of supporting myself. I worked 
as a docket clerk in the Division of Law at the state house in Trenton. I 
worked in the basement of the building, sometimes called the dungeon by those 
who worked there. I wrote titles of legal documents in large, musty record 
books. It was something to do; I could apply myself and I could forget myself, 
too. Thomas Carlyle, a Scottish essayist and historian, once wrote, "Work is 
the grand cure of all the maladies and miseries that ever beset mankind." That 
was certainly true in my case.
</p>
<p>
Luckily for me, the state library was right across the way. I went there on my 
lunch break to read about all the things that interested me - like music and 
computers. The work I was doing, itself, had a very small importance to the 
legal system; in that sense it was valuable. However, secretly, in my mind I 
knew I couldn't work there forever. The visits to the library kept a spark 
alive in me. Fyodor Dostoyevsky once wrote "Originality and a feeling of one's 
dignity are achieved only through work and struggle." I decided to go back to 
school at night to study computer science and work during the day. I definitely 
had my work cut out for me.
</p>
<p>
Over the years it took for me to graduate, I got a number of jobs. Each one led 
me closer to my ultimate goal of being a computer programmer/analyst. Once, I 
worked for a pharmaceutical company. The company was submitting their product 
to the FDA. I got a chance to work with databases containing the medical 
information. There I could lose myself in work, yes, but it wasn't out of 
self-disappointment. The work was genuinely interesting. And I knew there was 
something worthwhile in me to save. Finally, I did graduate from school and I 
was able to get my current job and achieve my goal. I'm doing the work I've 
struggled so hard to do. I'm very, very fortunate. It gives me a sense of 
identity that I hold to tenaciously.
</p>
<p>
But, how important is this work, this current job of mine? Is it really any 
more important than writing titles of legal documents in large, musty record 
books - as I did before? As a computer programmer, I'm entering arcane 
instructions into the computer that are stored on microscopic magnetic regions 
on a disk drive spinning hundreds of time per minute. A thunderstorm or a disk 
crash or a careless use of delete key could wipe out all that work. Also, these 
days, jobs are not necessarily secure. That form of work, that is, the mundane, 
could vanish tomorrow just like files on a disk drive. However, because of the 
other form of work I've had to do - through perseverance applied over the range 
of life experience - that is, force times distance - I have a more solid 
identity and spiritual foundation that allows me to continue despite setbacks. 
The spiritual work to be done, however, will never vanish.
</p>
<p>
Thomas Carlyle once wrote, "Blessed is he who has found his work. Let him ask 
no other blessedness." "Blessed is she, also!" I dare say with apologies to 
Thomas Carlyle. Am I blessed? I would say so.
</p>

<!-- begin solitude -->
<div class="content">

<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="solitude">Solitude </a></h3>
<p>
"Solitude is the play field of Satan." So wrote Vladimir Nabokov in his novel 
Pale Fire. But wait, Publilius Syrus, a writer of maxims in the first century 
BC, wrote "If you would live innocently, seek solitude." What is it about 
solitude that evokes such differing reactions?
</p>
<p>
According to the dictionary, solitude "refers the state of one who is 
completely alone, cut off from all human contact, and sometimes stresses the 
loneliness of such a condition." This sounds forbidding, but is it?
</p>
<p>
When I arrive home from work, the empty apartment can be rather intimidating. 
My mind is still racing. I say to myself, "Maybe I can solve that programming 
problem I encountered at work. That way I'll have the solution by the time I go 
back." So, I begin working on the computer. Then I ask, "What's going on in the 
world?" So I turn on the television. But I want more in depth coverage, so I 
turn down the television and turn on the radio. But what about that piece of 
music that I was working on - maybe I can finish that! Hmm, maybe I can go onto 
the Web; there's always something interesting there. What about dinner? I've 
got to have dinner. There's really nothing on television; maybe I can watch 
that old Star Trek video - I've only seen it ten thousand times! Well, you get 
the idea: soon I have too many things going on and a terrible electric bill. 
It's as if I'm trying to banish quiet and reflection that solitude might bring.
</p>
<p>
What if we were to remove the clutter and chaos in our lives? What would 
remain? We, ourselves, would remain - not a vacuum, but a plenum - all the 
unbidden thoughts and feelings that rise up and go out of existence. All of our 
ambitions and frustrations and longings and resentments and loves and hates 
would be there before us. Perhaps that is why solitude can be so difficult to 
experience.
</p>
<p>
One of my best memories of solitude occurred during high school. In the 
library, there was a window overlooking a field. During my free time, I would 
sit on the windowsill with a book. I might read, look out the window or simply 
think. These were very calming experiences.
</p>
<p>
My most difficult experiences, strangely, occur not when I'm alone, but when 
I'm a stranger in a group of people. There seems to be some invisible barrier 
between us. "How do they laugh so freely? What do they talk about? What's the 
secret?" I ask myself. These are genuine questions, but they are also some of 
those uncomfortable questions that well up out of nowhere. I try to observe 
these thoughts objectively and let them pass. Without the resentment and fear 
it might even be possible to say hello.
</p>
<p>
How do I react to someone else's solitude? My first impulse is to want to help 
- because I know what it is to be lonely. This is problematic, because I might 
be projecting my own discomfort on someone else. My mother is a good example. 
She has been rather ill lately. Her condition imposes many restrictions on her. 
She feels self-conscious and does not want to go out of the house. She's an 
independent person and it is difficult for me to see her this way. I try to 
bring some hustle and bustle and good cheer into the house. Sometimes I 
threaten to kidnap her and take her on a wild ride on I95 with the windows down 
and the CD player blaring. Yet I cannot impose this upon her; instead, I try to 
be gently encouraging while respecting her privacy.
</p>
<p>
Solitude is sometimes thrust upon us; sometimes we thirst for it. In any case, 
solitude can be a way for us to hear our own thoughts. In his book, Walden, 
Henry David Thoreau wrote, "I never found the companion that was so 
companionable as solitude." Yes, I suppose, just as Greta Garbo did, "I want to 
be alone," but only sometimes!

<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="community">A Sense of Community</a></h3>
<p>
I joined this church in 1998. In that time, I've met many wonderful people. At 
the beginning, I attended a social event here. I happened to talk to a woman 
who was a member of the congregation. I asked about the church and she told me 
a little about it. I asked if I might attend a service and she said I would be 
welcome. A few weeks later, I did go to a service and enjoyed it; I've been 
coming back ever since.
</p>
<p>
My family did go to church regularly when I was a child. My parents tried their 
best to give me and my brother and sister the best possible education - both 
intellectual and spiritual. However, my father died and that devastated us. I 
was about eleven at the time. I blamed God for the death of my father. I simply 
could not understand the logic behind it. My mother, of course, was left to 
raise the three children and go to work. She was so exhausted, we no longer 
attended church. In high school, I read all kinds of books on philosophy to try 
to figure out where I belonged. I read novels too; I was drawn to characters 
who were lost and questioning. I did survive this time of intense searching. I 
went to college and got a good job. But something was still missing. That's why 
I went back to church - to find my spirituality. My brother recently joined 
another church and my sister has been going to church for a long time. My 
mother said to me that she was happy that all of her children had found 
religion again.
</p>
<p>
I still have much to learn about religion; there is so much to learn. The open 
mindedness of Unitarian Universalism appeals to me. But it combines and 
balances this open mindedness with common sense, skepticism and intelligence. 
As I understand it, the Universalists believed that all souls can eventually 
find salvation. This is actually very encouraging. It means that someone like 
me, who feels different and disconnected, might be able to belong at last. The 
Unitarians believed in the oneness of God; they denied or doubted the divinity 
of Jesus, but accepted his moral teachings. Scientists estimate that the 
universe is 12 to 15 billion years old. I find it comforting, even necessary, 
that God, the creator of that immensity, would speak to us. This could only 
happen if Jesus was in human form - someone we could understand and recognize. 
So perhaps I'm not a complete UU! Because of the open mindedness of this 
church, I can, least debate these ideas with other people with mutual respect - 
despite my religious naivete!
</p>
<p>
However, ideas are not the only things that interest me. What keeps me coming 
back are the many wonderful people I've met here. I feel I belong here. I have 
a real sense of community.

<div class="content">
<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="racism">Are We a Racist Church?</a></h3>
<p>
Are we a racist church? I am a member of the church who happens to be black. 
I've been accepted at the church. I feel at home there. The church is a 
microcosm of society. The same problems that afflict the larger society might 
also exist in this smaller group. However, I would hesitate to describe any 
person or the institution itself as racist.
</p>
<p>
My parents seemingly grew up in a different world. Black people were completely 
segregated and treated as inferior. This was appalling. What I try to remember 
and understand is the incredible perserverance, hard work and strength it must 
have taken for my parents and countless other people to live under those 
conditions. Yet they did survive and this has transformed our society for the 
better. I hope I can continue the example they have set. There is still a lot 
to be done, though.
</p>
<p>
My concern is that we use the term racism too loosely. 'Racism' is a powerful 
word. It is used to describe inequities that exist in society. It can also be 
used to shame people. We must be careful how we use it. There is an 
open-mindedness at our church. People seem to be willing to listen. This is a 
very important attribute and can be used to bring about understanding among 
people. Surely we can be stronger if we work together. What do you think?

<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="internet">Privacy on the Internet</a></h3>
<p>
A free and responsible search for truth and meaning - that's the 4th UU 
Principle. Could the Internet be used to help us with this noble quest? What is 
the origin of this technology and should we trust it?
</p>
<p>
During the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), funded by 
the Department of Defense, was conducting research on how to get different 
computer networks to talk to each other. The scientists at the universities 
involved in the research needed a way to exchange information easily. At the 
time, there was no standard network hardware or communication protocols; it was 
like the tower of Babel. Eventually, ARPA did find a solution to the problem 
and linked together various universities including UCLA and Stanford. The 
number of interconnected networks increased rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s and 
also several important technologies emerged. For example, Tim Berners-Lee, a 
scientist at a particle physics lab in Switzerland, CERN, came up with the idea 
of using key words in data files to link to other related files - hyperlinks. 
Thus the World Wide Web was born. Mark Andreeson, came up with the first 
graphical web browser named Mosaic. Now, the World Wide Web is almost 
inescapable
</p>
<p>
The Internet, then, is an infrastructure, a vast lattice of computers and 
cables which store and transmit data. The World Wide Web is an easy to use 
interface to the Internet, providing us with data - text, graphics and sound - 
on just about any subject imaginable. It would seem to be the perfect way to 
conduct a free and responsible search for truth and meaning. Frequently, I stay 
up later than I would like to admit reading about all kinds of things such as 
music and the origin of the universe. I was even able to do some research on a 
medicine that my mother needed to take. I realize more and more how little I 
actually know.
</p>
<p>
But there is another side to all of this.
</p>
<p>
After the terrorist attacks in September of last year, everyone has become very 
concerned about our security. The FBI has several electronic surveillance 
programs. One is called Carnivore. It can be installed on an Internet Service 
Provider's computers and can scan data as it is transmitted from computer to 
computer. It can report on terrorist Internet activity, yes, but it could also 
be used to spy on average citizens. This software can only be used after 
obtaining a warrant from a judge, but the technology could be misused - and 
that is chilling.
</p>
<p>
Then there is the problem of malware - malicious software. These are computer 
programs - viruses, worms, trojans and the like - that infect or attach 
themselves to other programs and email messages. They are designed to replicate 
and transmit themselves through email, over computer networks or simply by 
exchanging files on floppy disks. These programs can corrupt data and shut down 
computer systems. Some of the people who design these programs are, perhaps, 
challenged by the technical difficulties involved. Others might indeed be 
malicious.
</p>
<p>
The Internet is an amazing combination of technologies. As any other tool, it 
can be used for good or evil. Francis Bacon, an English philosopher once wrote, 
"Knowledge is power." That is more true now than ever. Nothing is really free. 
As you surf the Web and search for your truth and your meaning, you must 
acquire knowledge, use your intelligence and be cautious just as you would in 
any realm of life. And don't forget to have fun!
</p>
<p>
But the human element is still the most important thing. It's so easy, at least 
for me, to hide behind the computer screen, away from the unpredictable world 
of people. The World Wide Web is an invaluable source of information, but it 
can never replace a dedicated, enthusiastic teacher. It can connect us in a way 
not imagined only a few years ago, but it can never replace the simple touch of 
a human hand. The Internet, then, is just one more network added to the 
interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="summer">The Spirituality of Summer</a></h3>
<p>
"Summer afternoon - summer afternoon; to me those have always been the two most 
beautiful words in the English language." So wrote Henry James in one of his 
novels. Summer has a special significance. During summer Sundays, UU people are 
unleashed on the world. Some UU churches are led by lay people during the 
summer; some churches close entirely. I once read a joke; it said:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot; Unitarians are the only group God can trust to be out of his 
	sight for two months at a time.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot; We get so far ahead of the devil in the winter that 
	we close down a couple months to give him a sporting chance to catch up.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alright then, what causes the seasons -summer - in particular? Our distance 
from the sun does change over the course of the year, but this does not have a 
very large affect. The earth, it seems, is tilted relative to the plane of its 
orbit around the sun. During this time of the year, the northern hemisphere is 
pointed more towards the sun and receives more light. In the winter it is 
tilted away from the sun and receives less light. Of course, the seasons are 
reversed for the southern hemisphere. The perturbations and eccentricities of 
the cosmos have conspired to give us a many of our traditions and rituals. What 
if the earth's pirouette was perfectly perpendicular? What if the earth's 
circumnavigation of the sun was certainly circular? Then life on earth might be 
a bit more bland. We are so small, yet we are intimately related to something 
so big - the universe.
</p>
<p>
Life abounds around us. The trees sway in the wind. The grass grows longer and 
longer - much to the chagrin of homeowners. The birds swoop from above. The 
bunny rabbits, squirrels and fellow humans scurry to their destinations. The 
beautiful flowers bloom. But what if one doesn't feel connected with this 
explosion of life? What if one's spirit is ebbing rather than overflowing? In 
one of his sonnets, Shakespeare wrote:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot; The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself it 
	only live and die.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Life can be very difficult. There are work problems and family problems and 
relationship problems and world problems and problems I never could have 
imagined. There can be many irritations large and small, so much so that life 
itself seems to be the problem. Despair of this magnitude overwhelms one's 
abilty to cope with the pain. This is a difficult problem; I have felt this. 
Under the sun's direct light, we are not frozen in place as we might be in 
winter. We can move and reach out. What I've realized is that other people have 
faced similar difficulties and survived. I realized that sometimes I must give 
myself distance from feelings of despair - like water off a duck's back. I 
realized that the feeling of relief and release can only occur if one is alive 
and connected. And I've realized that spiritual health is an ongoing process 
and must be cultivated.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this is why UUs relax during the summer. We get a chance to live and 
practice what we preach and experience all the things we've learned during the 
rest of the year.

<p>
Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker movement, wrote: "People say, what 
is the sense of our small effort. They cannot see that we must lay one brick at 
a time, take one step at a time. A pebble cast into a pond causes ripples that 
spread in all directions. Each one of our thoughts, words and deeds is like 
that. No one has a right to sit down and feel hopeless. There's too much work 
to do."
</p>
<p>
My parents grew up in a different world. At that time, black people were 
completely segregated and treated as inferior. What I try to remember and 
understand is the incredible perseverance, hard work and strength it must have 
taken for my parents and countless other people to live under those conditions. 
Yet they did survive and this has transformed our society for the better. They 
did not give in to despair; they moved forward tenaciously, just as Dorothy Day 
suggested. I hope I can continue the example they have set.
</p>
<p>
My parents wanted the best education for me. They sent me to a private school. 
Frequently, I was the only black person present. I was aware of discrimination 
in the larger world. I determined that I would be apolitical and neutral. I 
would adopt a tunnel vision and accomplish my goal. No one would hurt me 
because I would not allow my emotion to be touched. This approach had some 
merit, I suppose, but I could not perceive some of the complexity of things - 
good or bad.
</p>
<p>
After high school and college, I got a job. Once, I was working with a young 
black woman. At one point, after we had been talking for a while, she said, 
"You talk like you're white." I was shocked and hurt; I didn't quite know what 
it meant. It was simply the way I talked, what could I do?
</p>
<p>
Had I lost my culture? Was I lost between two worlds? Somehow, I don't think 
so. It took me a while to realize it. One can never really escape or destroy 
one's true nature. One can, I believe, adapt or transform oneself as a response 
to external influences and internal longings. My parents, although they were 
Methodist, seemed to have a UU view of the world. By attending the school I 
did, I was able to experience and appreciate many different cultures. For 
example, I can listen to Duke Ellington and Miles Davis as well as Johann 
Sebastian Bach and Bela Bartok. Surely, I'm a better person as a result of 
this.
</p>
<p>
Because of the gains made during the Civil Rights movement, I have been able to 
experience that broad vision of the world. But, are those hard won rights 
secure?
</p>
<p>
The most recent presidential election was important to me. I made sure that I 
voted. The ability to vote has not always been a right. In 1870, the Fifteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution gave black men the right to vote. In 1920, the 
Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act, which 
removed obstacles preventing minorities from voting, was passed in 1965. It was 
one of the more important accomplishments of the Civil Rights movement. The act 
was renewed and strengthened in 1982. All these events are relatively recent in 
our history, however. Even now, we can't take our rights for granted. John 
Philpot Curran, an Irish politician and judge, once said, "The condition upon 
which God has given liberty to man is eternal vigilance."
</p>
<p>
The election was contentious to be sure. Perhaps the country is divided between 
the more liberal values, which gave rise to the Civil Rights movement, and the 
more conservative values, which might return us to the past. However, I think 
this is a great country; it allows us to disagree and to stand up for our 
rights. The key is to continue a dialogue with those with whom we disagree, to 
see their humanity.
</p>
<p>
Mahandas Gandhi once said, "It is good to see ourselves as others see us. Try 
as we may, we are never able to know ourselves fully as we are, especially the 
evil side of us. This we can do only if we are not angry with our critics but 
will take in good heart whatever they might have to say."

<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="independence">Meditation on Independence and Freedom</a></h3>
<p>
Today is a good day to reflect on the meaning of independence and freedom. 
Often, my mind is so filled with mundane concerns, that I forget how lucky I 
am.
</p>
<p>
The Declaration of Indepenence says, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit 
of Happiness."
</p>
<p>
My parents grew up in a different world. Black people were completely 
segregated and treated as inferior. This was appalling. What I try to remember 
and understand is the incredible perserverance, hard work and strength it must 
have taken for my parents and countless other people to live under those 
conditions. Yet they did survive and this has transformed our society for the 
better. I hope I can continue the example they have set. Though, there is still 
a lot to be done, this country provided an environment in which this 
transformation could occur. People of good conscience were able to stand up and 
correct injustices for us all.
</p>
<p>
There is an interesting complexity to all of this, though. An oppressed person 
may throw off restrictions imposed from without. However, that person may still 
carry sprititual scars - a limited vision of themselves. At a recent Rainbow 
Coalition meeting, Bill Cosby made some despairing comments about some people 
in the black community. He said that some children were so badly educated that 
"they're going nowhere." He blamed the parents for this because they had not 
used the opportunities given by the civil rights movement. He said that at a 
certain point, blaming the society paralyzes you: "And it keeps a person frozen 
in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in."
</p>
<p>
If this is true, it is a terrible waste, but it's not hopeless. Gaining 
independence is an ongoing process. It took America many years to achieve the 
freedoms that we enjoy. There are so many opportunities in this country. 
However, we must sometimes fight our own internal limitations invisible to 
everyone around us to see those opportunities.
</p>
<p>
The Bill of Rights says, among other things, "Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof;" This is one small sentence in the many articles of the Constitution, 
yet it is extremely important.
</p>
<p>
My family did go to church regularly when I was a child. My parents tried their 
best to give me and my brother and sister the best possible education - both 
intellectual and spiritual. My family was Methodist, however, my childish mind 
simply could not understand the logic behind it. In high school, I read all 
kinds of books on philosophy to try to figure out where I belonged. I read 
novels too; I was drawn to characters who were lost and questioning. I did 
survive this time of intense searching. My brother and sister seemed to be 
searching, too. I went to college and got a good job. But something was still 
missing. That's why I went back to church, this church: to find my 
spirituality. The open mindedness of Unitarian Universalism appeals to me. But 
it combines and balances this open mindedness with common sense, skepticism and 
intelligence. My brother recently joined another church and my sister has been 
going to church for a long time. My mother once said to me that she was happy 
that all of her children had found religion again.
</p>
<p>
Because of that right written into the Constitution long ago, I was able to go 
on my spiritual quest and find my place.
</p>
<p>
Look around you. This is a beautiful place inhabited by beautiful people free 
to exchange ideas. Suppose all that was taken away - everything I expect and 
hope for - by some tyrannical government or power. Would I have the strength to 
fight for what I believe in? Think of the people in the thirteen colonies 
fighting for independence. Their's was not an easy struggle. Could I have 
survived that? I'd like to think so, but I don't know for sure.
</p>
<p>
The day of 9/11 started out like any other day for me. I was impatient with the 
traffic on Route 1. At work, I wanted to complete a project as quickly as 
possible. When I heard of the attacks, I was awakened from a kind of 
complacency. I was drawn out of myself into the larger world around me. My 
lasting impression is that our lives and our freedoms are fragile and must be 
cherished and protected. Perhaps John Philpot Curran was correct when he wrote, 
"The condition upon which God has given liberty to man is eternal vigilance."

<div class="content">
<h3 class="title"><a href="#top" name="computers">The Human Side of Computers</a></h3>
<p>
When people ask me what I do for a living, I often hesitate. In response, they 
might say, "Oh, a computer programmer! That must be so boring!" Or they might 
say, "Oh, you're one of those computer people! Those computers are everywhere, 
the bane of our existence!" Or they might say, "My computer locks up for no 
reason. It's driving me crazy!" Sometimes I want to run and hide. These 
computers, though, are a human creation and they have human qualities - good 
and bad - and this is what makes them so interesting and infuriating.
</p>
<p>
My interest in computers began in elementary school. The school that I attended 
had a computer - just one computer. In those days, just after the Jurassic 
period, computers were not so commonplace. By our standards today, it was 
indeed a dinosaur. It was the size of a refrigerator and had external magnetic 
tape reels on the front. One entered programs on a noisy Teletype. And, worst 
of all, one had to reserve time on the computer, because, of course, other 
people wanted to use it as well. Despite all this, computers fascinated me and 
I wanted to write computer programs.
</p>
<p>
Computers don't understand our language or think as we do. Therein lies the 
challenge. We humans have shared memories, experiences, and expectations, 
languages and protocols that we can rely upon to communicate with each other. 
We can reason, solve problems, create new ideas - and countless other things 
that we take for granted. But how can one systematically describe such 
activities. This task is more difficult than it might seem and makes one 
wonder: what is human intelligence? In order to tell the computer to do a task, 
one must write a very specific set of instructions written in an extremely 
restricted language that the computer can interpret. This is programming at its 
most basic level. However, there are so many interesting possibilities opened 
up by this simple activity - writing a series of instructions.
</p>
<p>
After high school, I went to college briefly, but I wasn't quite sure what to 
do with my life. So instead, I took a break from school and got a job. My 
interest in computers and things electronic continued. But a question plagued 
me. How do I make this interest into something useful? I became impatient with 
myself; I knew I could be doing more with my life. I went back to school at 
night and studied computer science; I worked during the day. At the time I was 
working for a pharmaceutical company; I helped set up databases for their 
medical studies. My supervisor was throwing away obsolete computers and 
replacing them with new models. So he said I could keep one of the old 
computers. I was amazed. This was one of the best things that could happen. It 
allowed me to work on programs at home as well as at school. This was both good 
and bad. I could do more work but I was up until three in the morning solving 
interesting problems, drinking black cherry soda and eating chocolate chip 
cookies. Often, I become so involved in a problem that I simply can't stop 
until I solve it.
</p>
<p>
After a lot of work, I earned my degree and got a job as a programmer. This was 
important to me because in some sense I could say this is my identity, this is 
who I am. The challenges remain, though. How to get the computer to perform 
useful tasks? On the job, there is an additional challenge: the deadline. 
Recently, my co-workers and I worked on a project; it had to be completed by a 
certain date - without a doubt. I did not have the luxury of contemplating 
technical problems at my leisure. We all worked long hours and we did finish on 
time. From the outside the job might seem boring. All I do is sit at a computer 
all day and type arcane instructions. But there is a quiet drama going on. I 
feel panic when things go wrong and elation when things go as expected.
</p>
<p>
But, am I a "hacker" in the best sense of the word or am I a corporate 
automaton? The term "hacker" was originally defined as a computer enthusiast or 
explorer, someone who takes a joyful interest in solving the problems posed by 
computers - everything from networks, to user interfaces to artificial 
intelligence. In the book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution the author 
Steven Levy states the hacker's ethic as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Access to computers should be unlimited and total</li>
<li>All information should be free</li>
<li>Mistrust authority - promote decentralization</li>
<li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race or position</li>
<li>You create art and beauty on a computer</li>
<li>Computers can change your life for the better</li>
</ol>
<p>
Some of these tenets sound similar to UU principles. I'd like to believe that 
even within the rigid structure of my job, there is still room for creativity 
and even play - although on a very compressed time scale. So maybe I'm a hacker 
after all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I went into the church office. A member of the congregation, Howard 
Bennett, was sitting at the computer reorganizing files. As he worked, he was 
talking to himself or maybe he was talking to the computer or maybe he was 
talking to me. I assured him this happens to me all the time when I'm working 
on one of those infernal machines. The next time you switch on your computer, 
remember that there is a human face behind the integrated circuits.
